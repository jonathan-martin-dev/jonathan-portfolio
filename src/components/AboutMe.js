          About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
          My name is Jonathan Martinez and I am a Front-End Engineer with over 3
          years of experience. I've worked on both E-Commerce and Marketing
          teams to provide better buying experiences for customers. I have
          delivered projects that have provided a growth in overall online sales
          and in some cases, created new opportunities for the business.
        </p>
        <p>
          To me, the best work environments are collaborative ones. I love being
          on teams where we can share ideas and learn from each other. I'm
          passionate about learning new technologies and every single project I
          have worked on has taught me something new. Each challenge I've faced
          has created a new set of problem solving skills. I am constantly
          growing in this field and it's why I love to code.

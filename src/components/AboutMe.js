          About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Jonathan Martinez, a Front-End Engineer based in the Greater
          Los Angeles area with over 3 years of experience. I've worked on both
          E-Commerce and Marketing teams to provide better buying experiences
          for customers. I have delivered projects that have provided a growth
          in overall online sales and in some cases, created new opportunities
          for the business.
        </p>
        <p>
          To me, the best work environments are collaborative ones. I love being
          on teams where we can share ideas and learn from each other. I'm
          passionate about learning new technologies and every single project I
          have worked on has taught me something new. Each challenge I've faced
          has created a new set of problem solving skills. I am constantly
          growing in this field and it's why I love to code.
